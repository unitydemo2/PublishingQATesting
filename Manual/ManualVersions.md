# Documentation versions


The version of the documentation which accompanies the current full release of Unity is always available online at **[docs.unity3d.com](http://docs.unity3d.com/)**. 

### Installer (offline) documentation
As well as using the online documentation, you can install it locally on your computer when you install the Unity software. Prior to Unity 5.3, the documentation was *always* installed along with the software. From version 5.3 onwards, you can choose whether to install the documentation locally via the [Unity Download Assistant](InstallingUnity.md).

### Documentation updates
We republish the online documentation for the current full release version of Unity regularly with corrections and missing content regularly. (You can see the publish version of the documentation at the bottom of every page.)
